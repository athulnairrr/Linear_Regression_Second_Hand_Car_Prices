# Linear_Regression_Second_Hand_Car_Prices
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankpatel14/second-hand-used-cars-data-set-linear-regression

Linear Regression Project:

Started with a discussion on a linear regression project.
Chose to work on second-hand car prices.
Dataset Selection:

Shared a dataset with columns like on road old, on road now, years, etc.
Data Preprocessing:

Unzipped and loaded the dataset.
Explored preprocessing steps for the chosen dataset.
Code for Dataset Preprocessing:

Shared code for unzipping in Google Colab.
Discussed preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and normalization.
Linear Regression Modeling:

Chose linear regression for the second-hand car prices project.
Evaluation Metrics:

Discussed and implemented evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared.
Visualization:

Proposed visualizations post-evaluation, such as predicted vs. actual plots and feature importance.
Model Overview:

Summarized the linear regression model steps, including feature engineering, regularization, and evaluation.
Conclusion:

Emphasized the need for careful interpretation and potential next steps.
